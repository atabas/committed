# Committed

This is a handy reminder app which allows anyone to sign up as a user via authentication with Github and tracks their commits.
It sends a reminder in the form of an email on the day that the user did not commit code to Github, in order to encourage them
to maintain their daily streak of code commits.

This app was built with Node.js, MongoDB, Mongoose and React.
